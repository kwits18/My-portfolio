# My-portfolio
This is my portfolio of some projects I have done both in school and on my own.

My JavaEmployeeExample program is a simple Java example of what I would code to input and output employee data 

The other Calculator program lets you enter two numbers and gives you a list of options to add, subtract, mulitply and divide
While it does this, it also imports another file called Mylib which contains functions to show my ability to reuse old code
